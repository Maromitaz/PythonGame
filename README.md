# PythonGame
~~This repository is a little game/framework that I work on and I hope I don't mess it up and actually finish it, unlike my previous attempts on making games.~~\
I've abandoned this game, I will return to it when I feel like I have enough experience to make a good game.\
By that I mean to learn more about python and C to make my own C implementations to make the game run not only smoother, but with less resources.
